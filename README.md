## Inspiration

We were inspired from the problem statement given by the Ministry of Commerce and Industries for the Smart India Hackathon 2023. The problem states to implement an interactive gaming application for school students to teach about Intellectual Properties Rights (IPR). We found it a pretty challenging problem statement. Our interest in game development has given us the desire to create an entertaining yet knowledge building challenge. Rise in student prodigies has given the world great inventions, which are left unpatented or get a patent at a later stage. This raises the issue of theft of Intellectual Property Rights. What's the purpose of his invention if his intellectual properties are been stolen by some other and they get the credit.


## What it does

It gives an story based game for the players where they solve the case by listening and understanding the background story and finding out the hidden clues in the background conversation. Later the player,who is an attorney, needs to gather information in an open world scenario by recalling the conversation and figuring out where the clues is hidden. The player then needs to collect the clues and submit it as an evidence to win the case.

## How we built it

We have built it in an interactive way by making the problem into a gamified solution. The tech stack we used were 
Unity for building the prototype,
Blender for modelling the assets required for the game,
C# Scripts for the game logic 
A few free to use assets for our scenario's from online artists.

## Challenges we ran into

- Modelling the required assets which is most suitable for our scene. 
- Script Logic for different scenarios for event triggers.
- Integrating and AI assistant for proving the general information.
- Training the AI model to give relevant information.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Successful integration of an AI model which gives appropriate information on feed data.
- A working prototype of our game which is interactive and entertaining.

## What we learned

###On the technical stuff,
- Learning **Unity** which gave us a good exposure on how are games.
- **Blender** which gave us the flexibility of using our creativity beyond limits.
- **C#** 

###On the non-technical stuff,
- **Time Management** was a crucial thing that we have successfully managed.
- **Splitting the work** which kept us a bit challenging position.
- **Switching roles** so the everyone would get equal exposure of every aspect of the tech stack that we have implemented.

## What's next for Gamify IPR

- Adding new Cases.
- Making younger audience play the game and make it an interactive and entertaining
- Optimizing the assets to make the application light weight.
- Adding extra controls for other platforms.
